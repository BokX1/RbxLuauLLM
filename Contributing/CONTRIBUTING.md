# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to RbxLuauLLM!

This project is intended for **authorized/dev/admin/testing contexts only**.

## Ground rules

- **No secrets in commits**: API keys, tokens, private endpoints, credential-like strings.
- **No misuse enablement**: don’t add instructions or code aimed at bypassing permissions/ToS.
- Keep PRs small and focused.
- Update docs when behavior changes.
